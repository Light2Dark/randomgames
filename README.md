# Random Games App

A Unity-made mobile app to implement some learnt skills and to laugh at the lack of it.

## Installation

The builds to the game will be included in this repository under the 'builds' folder. 
To install in your phone:

(**Currently unavailable on Playstore & Appstore so this is to install manually**)

**Android:** 
1. Go to the Builds folder
2. Transfer the PogGamesv1.apk file to your phone.
3. Run the app in your phone.
4. Enable installation of unknown apps in your phone (if needed).
5. Your phone will install it.
6. Run the game!

**Apple**

1. I don't think it works because Apple has strict policies on manual installation of foreign apps but maybe in the far future.
